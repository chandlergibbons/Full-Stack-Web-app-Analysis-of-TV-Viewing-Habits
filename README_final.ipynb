    "* The Emmys Webscrape was touted as 'a full list' on Vanity Fair but was actually only a selection of award categories centered around actors writers or directors (telecast) and left out a lot of the behind-the-scenes creative arts awards categories caentered around design, costume, make-up, sound mixing, visual effects etc. Those features absolutely contribute to the full asethetic of a television program so our dataset may not fully convey some shows full number of nominations. \n",
    "* We have one field in our dataset called, 'channel,' which refers to the network that emmys.com attributed the shows origin to. While we used that as our beacon of truth, many of the programs live on multiple streaming networks. Many of the popular shows may have premiered on FX but have since been swallowed up by larger networks so any analysis comparing network content may be difficult based on the overlapping family trees.\n",
    "* As a future consideration, it may be interesting to use this dataset as a foundation to explore consolidation of tv networks and the competitive landscape, looking at subscriber and financial data."
