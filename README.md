OVERVIEW: The dataset created, cleaned and analyzed is characterized by consumer television viewing trends and ratings. As a starting point, we web scraped Emmy nominations from 2016-2020 and used that dataset as an anchor point and calculated the nomination frequency filtered by title. From there, we merged viewing medium (channel), IMDB scores, Reel scores and Rotten Tomatoes scores.
